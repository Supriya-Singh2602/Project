# Project:The aim of the project presents the concept functional physical model of air purification system for small public spaces or apartments the purifier is controlled by a microcontroller. SOHO PureHome Connect Smart Purifier improves indoor air quality using a 5-Stage Purification system.1. A Pre-Filter (B) captures larger particles like hair, lint, pet dander and household dust.2. A HEPA Filter (A) captures and reduces up to 99.97% of airborne particles, mould, pollen and other allergens down to 0.3 microns.3. An Active Carbon Filter (C) removes household odours and noxious gases.4. An Anion Emitter emits negative ions that serve to attract airborne particulates and cause them to coalesce into larger clusters so that they can easily be filtered.5. An Ultraviolet Lamp irradiates UV-C rays around the fan and disinfects filtered air. Through continuous operation of the purifier, the air is circularly disinfected.
